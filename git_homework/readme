For creating 2 or more commits with similar hashes we need to use environment variables

Example:
1. do similar changes in both repos and use git add *
2. use GIT_AUTHOR_DATE="2020.02.23 16:45" GIT_COMMITTER_DATE="2020.02.23 16:45" \
       git commit -m "my commit"
3. done

Another way is making commits in one command
